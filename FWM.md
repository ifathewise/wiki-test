<b>Why should you Fuel What Matters?</b>

Every time you take a bus or train, you help protect what matters: clean air and energy security. 
By fueling public transit, we can reduce harmful emissions from single occupancy vehicles and reduce our 
dependency on fossil fuels. Fuel What Matters is a TV, radio and digital media campaign designed to reduce 
harmful vehicle emissions by encouraging the use of cleaner fuels (biofuels, electricity, natural gas and propane), 
transit, bicycle and pedestrian options by sharing compelling stories and helpful decision-making resources. 
Led by the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center (NCCETC), Fuel What Matters is the new, one-stop shop for 
both consumers and leaders in business and government to evaluate how they can contribute to a cleaner air tomorrow.

“Fuel What Matters will help get you where you want to go whether it’s by walking, biking, transit, or in a personal 
or business vehicle,” commented NCCETC Transportation Manager Anne Tazewell. At the center of the campaign which includes 
TV and radio spots, bus advertising and more is a dedicated microsite FuelWhatMatters.org designed to connect the public 
as well as leaders in business and the public sector to information about alternative fuels, fleet decision making aides 
and compelling stories or case studies. The site also features two of the campaign’s public service announcements, which 
feature the Mayor of the City of Raleigh, the CEO of Waste Industries, and two private citizens. Though Fuel What Matters 
offers some North Carolina specific resources, the campaign is open to people from every corner of the country, because clean 
air is something in which everyone has a stake.

To help get the word out, the campaign also features a Twitter, Instagram and Facebook contest which is currently awarding 
$100 cash prizes each month to random social media users who use the hashtag #FuelWhatMatters.

For fleet managers and alternative fuel organizations, Fuel What Matters provides information to help you better manage your fleet. 
It also contains a “Buyers Book” that provides important contact information for clean transportation technology vendors.

So before you turn on the ignition of your car and get on that busy road, think about what is important and consider how you can 
Fuel What Matters!
