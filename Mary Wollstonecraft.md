<b>Mary Wollstonecraft</b>

Mary Wollstonecraft (/ˈwʊlstən.krɑːft/; 27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was an English writer, 
philosopher, and advocate of women's rights. During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, 
a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children's book. 
Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she argues 
that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. 
She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social 
order founded on reason.
